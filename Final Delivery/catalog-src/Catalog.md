# Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury in Pediatric Patients: A CDS App

This web-based app provides clinical decision support for the area of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) in children and adolescents. It provides an extensible CDS framework which can be expanded with new rules as well as a customizable Angular-based user interface.

The app was started in the Fall of 2017 as a semester project for Georgia Tech's Introduction to Health Informatics course and was greatly informed by the input of our mentors (listed below).
